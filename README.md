Sort Algorithm Visualizer
======
A simple visualizer that shows how different sorting algorithms work. Inspired by Clément Mihalescu, I started this project as a way to cement my knowledge of multiple topics (see [Motivation](#motivation) below) & to make a portfolio.



Features
------
In order to display & execute the sorting algorithms the app works with a node list comprised of the nodes that represent the bars that the user sees. The sorting algorithms work over this node list and changes the heigth value of the bars when the algorithm calls for a swap.
With this design the implementation of new algorithms becomes streamlined

The current sorting algorithms are:
  + Quick sort
  + Merge sort
  + Bubble sort
  + Selection sort
  + Insertion sort



Usage
------
Go to the hosting site (put link HERE) & start sorting!



Motivation
------
I created this project to learn JavaScript and it´s interactions with html/css, also implement what I have learned about sorting algorithms. And finally it was a great start to the ins and outs of git & github.
